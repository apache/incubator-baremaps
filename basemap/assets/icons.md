# OpenStreetMap-Carto Icons

The icons stored in this directory come from the [OpenStreetMap-Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/) 
project released under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication, version 1.0, as published by Creative Commons.

Created by Andy Allan <andy@gravitystorm.co.uk> and contributors.
Based on original cartography by Steve Chilton and others.

The icons.png and icons.json files are generated from the SVG files using the following spreet command [spreet](https://github.com/flother/spreet).

```
spreet --sdf --ratio 4 icons icons
```

The resolution is set to 4x so that one can increase the size of the icons without losing quality.

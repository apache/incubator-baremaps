# OpenStreetMap Vecto

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ ðŸš§

This directory contains the configuration files for a general-purpose map.
It is used to generate vector tiles and to produce a Mapbox style inspired by [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

## Requirements

* [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) 13+
* [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) 3+
* [Java](https://adoptium.net/) 17+
* [Baremaps](https://www.baremaps.com/) 0.7+

A PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension should be accessible with the following jdbc settings:

```
jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/baremaps?user=baremaps&password=baremaps
```

## Getting started

Assuming that the necessary requirements have been installed, the database can be populated with the following command.

```
baremaps workflow execute --file workflow.js
```

The development server can be started with the following command.

```
baremaps map dev --log-level DEBUG \
  --database 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/baremaps?user=baremaps&password=baremaps' \
  --tileset 'tileset.js' \
  --style 'style.js'
```

## Editing the tileset

The configuration format used in the `tileset.js` file extends the [TileJSON specification](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/tree/master/2.2.0).
Simply put, it adds in the ability to describe the `vector_tiles` and their content with SQL queries that follow the PostGIS dialect.

```
{
  "tilejson": "2.2.0",
  "tiles": [
    "http://localhost:9000/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"
  ],
  "vector_layers": [
    {
      "id": "aerialway",
      "queries": [
        {
          "minzoom": 14,
          "maxzoom": 20,
          "sql": "SELECT id, tags, geom FROM osm_ways_z${zoom} WHERE tags ? 'aerialway'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Editing the style

The configuration format used in the `line.js` file follows the [Mapbox style specification](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).
Baremaps integrates [Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/) and most of the modifications will take place in the browser.

```

Then, build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can then link the script to your path in order to use it as a command line tool:

```

## Usage

In order to get a list of the available commands, run:

```bash
baremaps-renderer --help
```

### Running the Tests

Within a directory containing a `tests` folder, you can run the tests by running:

```bash
baremaps-renderer run -s <styleUrl>
```

After the tests are run, a report is generated `tests/report.html`. You can view the report by opening the file in your browser or by running:

```bash
baremaps-renderer report --open
```

## Creating a New Test

Within a directory containing a `tests` folder, you can add a new test by creating a folder in the `tests/integration` directory. Each test is a folder containing a metadata file `metadata.json`. The metadata file is as follows:

```json
{
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512,
  "center": [6.6323, 46.5197],
  "zoom": 14
}
```

- `width:` the width of the image in pixels
- `height:` the height of the image in pixels
- `center:` the center of the map longitude, latitude
- `zoom:` the zoom level of the map

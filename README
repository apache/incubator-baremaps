# Apache Baremaps (incubating)

Apache Baremaps (incubating) is a toolkit for creating custom vector tiles from OpenStreetMap
and other data sources with Postgis and Java.

In order to build Baremaps from source, you first need to install Java 17 and Maven 3.8.1.
Then, you can build Baremaps with the following command:

    $ mvn clean install

To install the distribution, run the following command:

    $ unzip baremaps-cli/target/baremaps-[VERSION]-incubating-src.zip

You can then add the `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment variable.

    $ export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/baremaps/bin

[Baremaps](https://www.baremaps.com/) is a toolkit for creating custom vector tiles from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and other data sources with Postgis and Java. The project is licensed under [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

[![State of the map](/docs/assets/screenshot.jpg)](https://www.baremaps.com/assets/demo.html)

Baremaps is inspired by [Osmosis](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis), but it comes with additional features, such as the ability to:
-   Process data in parallel with the [Stream API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) introduced in Java 8
-   Import data faster with the [COPY API](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-copy.html) of Postgresql
-   Create postgis geometries on the fly with [JTS](https://github.com/locationtech/jts)
-   Create and serve customized [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/)

On the longer run, the aim of the project is to work with a variety of data sources in order to create highly specialized and customized maps.

## Start Hacking

* To contribute to this repo see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* To build baremaps. You'll need `maven` and `Java 11`. 
* `cd baremaps-cli && mvn package -P maputnik -B`. This creates a `.zip` in the `target` folder.
* alternatively you can build a docker image with `mvn jib:dockerBuild -DskipTests`.

To help you start without worring too much a "starter" [openstreetmap](https://github.com/baremaps/openstreetmap-vecto) project is available

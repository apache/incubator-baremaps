  title: "A sample API conforming to the draft standard OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core"
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |-
    This is a sample OpenAPI definition that conforms to the conformance
    classes "Core", "GeoJSON", "HTML" and "OpenAPI 3.0" of the draft
    standard "OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core".

    This example is a generic OGC API Features definition that uses path
    parameters to describe all feature collections and all features.
    The generic OpenAPI definition does not provide any details on the
    collections or the feature content. This information is only available
    from accessing the feature collection resources.

    There is [another example](ogcapi-features-1-example2.yaml)
    that specifies each collection explicitly.

        Fetch features of the feature collection with id `collectionId`.

        Every feature in a dataset belongs to a collection. A dataset may
        consist of multiple feature collections. A feature collection is often a
        collection of features of a similar type, based on a common schema.

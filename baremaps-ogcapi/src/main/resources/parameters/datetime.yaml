description: |-
  Either a date-time or an interval. Date and time expressions adhere to RFC 3339. 
  Intervals may be bounded or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).

  Examples:

  * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
  * A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
  * Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"

  Only features that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
  `datetime` are selected.

  If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
  server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
  the extent or all relevant temporal properties.

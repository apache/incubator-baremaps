            The collections (geospatial data resources) shared by this API.
            This response can be references directly for every service that wants only essential information at the collections level. /collections/collectionId might return more information.
            The dataset is organized as one or more collections. This resource provides information about and how to access the collections.
            The response contains the list of collections. For each collection, a link
            to other resources present (e.g. the items in the collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/items`,
            link relation `items`, a map created with data from  collection, path `/collections/{collectionId}/map`,
            link relation `map`) as well as key information about the collection.
            This information includes, but is not limited to:
            * A local identifier for the collection that is unique for the dataset;
            * A list of coordinate reference systems (CRS) in which geometries may be returned by the server. The first CRS is the default coordinate reference system (the default is always WGS84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
            * An optional title and description for the collection;
            * An optional extent that can be used to provide an indication of the spatial and temporal extent of the collection - typically derived from the data;

        If the collection submitted in the request body includes an

        already exists, an error is returned.

        If no identifier can be determined from the submitted
        collection, the server will assign a new identifier to the
        collection.

        The URI of the new collection is returned in the header

      description: |-
        Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box are selected.
        The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the
        coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
        * Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
        * Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

        If the value consists of four numbers, the coordinate reference system is
        WGS 84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        If the value consists of six numbers, the coordinate reference system is WGS 84 
        longitude/latitude/ellipsoidal height (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h)
        unless a different coordinate reference system is specified in the parameter `bbox-crs`.

        The query parameter `bbox-crs` is specified in OGC API - Features - Part 2: Coordinate 
        Reference Systems by Reference.

        For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the values are in most cases the sequence of
        minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
        However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
        (west-most box edge) is larger than the third or fourth value (east-most box edge).

        If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are
        the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

        If a feature has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the
        server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine
        the extent or all relevant geometries.

        The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
        The features included in the response are determined by the server
        based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
        larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
        paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
        that the page size.

        The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
        subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
        bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
        in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
        `datetime` parameter matches all features in the collection that are
        not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

        The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
        selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
        Each page may include information about the number of selected and
        returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
        links to support paging (link relation `next`).

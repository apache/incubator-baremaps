/**
 * Utility methods for creating coordinate reference systems.

 * This method first looks into a minimal set of crs definitions that are hardcoded in the
 * application. This includes the "WSG 84" and "WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator" coordinate reference
 * systems.
 * <p>
 * Then, it tries to create a CRS from the EPSG code that may be stored in the proj4/nad/epsg
 * resource file of the proj4j-epsg module.
 * <p>
 * The proj4j-epsg module is not included in baremaps by default due to licensing issues. It can be
 * added to the classpath to enable the creation of CRS from EPSG codes.

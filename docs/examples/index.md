# Examples

Several examples illustrate how to import datasets in postgis in order to produce vector tiles:
- The [OpenStreetMap](/examples/openstreetmap/) example is a good introduction to Baremaps, it shows how to produce high resolution vector tiles.
- The [Extrusion](/examples/openstreetmap/) builds upon the OpenStreetMap example and shows how to extrude buildings.
- The [NaturalEarth](/examples/naturalearth/) example shows how to produce low resolution vector tiles.
- The [Contour](/examples/contour/) example shows how to produce contour lines from a digital elevation model.

The [OpenStreetMap Vecto](/stylesheet/) repository shows how to build a more advanced configuration and stylesheet for Baremaps.

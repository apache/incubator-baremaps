# Examples

Several examples illustrate how to import datasets in postgis in order to produce vector tiles:
- The [OpenStreetMap](/examples/openstreetmap/) example is a good introduction to Baremaps, it shows how to produce high resolution vector tiles.
- The [NaturalEarth](/examples/naturalearth/) example shows how to produce low resolution vector tiles;
- The [Contour](/examples/contour/) example shows how to produce contour lines from a digital elevation model;

The [OpenStreetMap Vecto](/stylesheet/) repository shows how to build a more advanced configuration and stylesheet for Baremaps.
